                        JavaScript map, forEach, filter & find methods are only applicable on array. They all are used to access the data from an array more efficiently.
                        <br> <br>
                        although all of them are array methods, there are some major differences among them. such as: 
                        <br> <br>
                        * map, filter or find returns the output in an array, but forEach doesn't return anything. 
                        <br> <br>
                        * if there exists any empty element inside an array, the map, filter or find doesn't execute functions for empty elements. But, forEach will run over those empty elements & provides "undefined". 
                        <br> <br>
                        * map will call the particular function for each elements of the array & change or update all the elements accordingly. On the other hand, filter will only provide the elements that passes the certain condition or function. 
                        <br> <br>
                        * Though map & filter can provide multiple elements based on original array or conditions imposed, but the find method will always provide single element as the output.

                        Usage of localStorage or sessionStorage & even the cookies are so effective in regards of 'Web Storage API'. Webpages & servers can use them collectively to make the user experience much fluent & interactive as all of them work on users personal preferences such as settings or log-in credentials autosaving, etc. 
                        <br> <br>
                        There are some major differences among them in terms of their mode of action. 
                        <br> <br>
                        * Both in localStorage or sessionStorage data can only be saved onto the browser or users local memory while, cookies can use both the browser & the server storage. 
                        <br> <br>
                        * Cookies or localStorage data remain saved until the user clears it manually, while sessionStorage data are cleared immediately after the session ends. 
                        <br> <br>
                        * Data transfer speed are not equal for all of the aforesaid process. Usually data storage capacity for cookies, localStorage & sessionStorage are 4kb, 10mb & 5mb accordingly.

                        A <b>callback function</b> is a function <b>passed as an argument to another function</b>. This technique allows a function to call another function. JavaScript functions are executed in the sequence they are called.
                        <br> By this process, currently active or running function <b>can use previously formed any other functions</b> as needed. It is very useful regarding usage of re-usable functions.
