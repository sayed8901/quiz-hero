                        JavaScript map, forEach, filter & find methods are only applicable on array. They all are used to access the data from an array more efficiently.
                        <br> <br>
                        although all of them are array methods, there are some major differences among them. such as: 
                        <br> <br>
                        * map, filter or find returns the output in an array, but forEach doesn't return anything. 
                        <br> <br>
                        * If there exists any empty element inside an array, the map, filter or find doesn't execute functions for empty elements. But, forEach will run over those empty elements & provides "undefined". 
                        <br> <br>
                        * map will call the particular function for each elements of the array & change or update all the elements accordingly. On the other hand, filter will only provide the elements that passes the certain condition or function. 
                        <br> <br>
                        * Though map & filter can provide multiple elements based on original array or conditions imposed, on the contrary the find method will always provide a single (the first matched) element as the output.

                        Usage of localStorage or sessionStorage & even the cookies are so effective in regards of 'Web Storage API'. Webpages & servers can use them collectively to make the user experience much fluent & interactive as all of them work on users personal preferences such as settings or log-in credentials autosaving, etc. 
                        <br> <br>
                        There are some major differences among them in terms of their mode of action. 
                        <br> <br>
                        * Both in localStorage or sessionStorage data can only be saved onto the browser or user's local memory while, cookies can use both the browser & the server storage. 
                        <br> <br>
                        * Cookies or localStorage data remain saved until the user clears it manually, while sessionStorage data are cleared immediately after the session ends. 
                        <br> <br>
                        * Data transfer speed are not equal for all of the aforesaid process. Usually data storage capacity for cookies, localStorage & sessionStorage are 4kb, 10mb & 5mb accordingly.

                    What is event loop in javaScript? How does it actually work?

                        JS event loop is a runtime process model which performs the execution of the code of a javaScript file in the browser or web-page. 
                        <br> <br>
                        There is a call stack used in event loop where the tasks are stacked sequentially. There also might be sub-tasks within a task such as: callbacks. When one stack (with its all sub-tasks) is finished, call-stack automatically calls the next stack. This is known as sequentially or synced execution context.
                        <br> <br>
                        JavaScript event loop can also handle event queue. It means, javaScript can use 'await' functionality while waiting for the response of a particular operation & meanwhile event loop can execute the other call stacks.
                        <br> <br>
                        This is how, although being a single-threaded programming language, javascript can handle synchronous & asynchronous operations at a time by using its unique event loop process which incudes the call stack & event queue data structure.

                        Here, 'quizTimer()' function uses a parameter named 'dismiss'. If 'dismiss' is true, then timer interval will be cleared by using 'clearInterval()'.
                        <br> <br>
                        If 'dismiss' is false, 'setInterval()' function makes dynamic "timings". Here in this function, 'Math.floor()' creating the numbers dynamically.
                        <br> <br>
                        After that, these timings including 'minutes' & 'seconds' are injected onto the 'countHtml' element by using innerHTML. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Lastly, the timing updating interval is set to '1000' to update it once in every second.

                        'chooseQuiz()' function will use 2 parameter named 'index' & 'givenAns'. Inside this function, by using the 'find()' method, given answer is compared with the JSON data by the 'index no' to the 'id'.
                        <br> <br>
                        If the 'id' exists & matched with the JSON data, required answer is added using 'splice'.
                        <br> <br>
                        finally, to display or show the desired 'answer', 'displayAnswers()' is being called.

                        <br> <br> <br>
                        'displayAnswers()' firstly performs a 'sort' operation to sort the answers by its "id".
                        <br> <br>
                        Then, individual quiz data can be generated here by using 'forEach()'.
                        <br> <br>
                        Finally, 'innerHTML' is used to create & add  data dynamically.
